This is Rahul Das' Portfolio. Rahul is a senior at UT Dallas studying computer science.

#### Running My Programs Locally
Clone this repo locally in a directory of your choice using:

`git clone https://github.com/rahuld0219/Rahul_Portfolio.git`

## Overview of NLP
You can see the [document here](Overview_of_NLP.pdf)
### Description
This pdf document gives a general overview of Natural Language Processing.

## Homework 1
You can see the [code here](Homework1/Homework1.py)
### Description
This program parses a CSV file containing employee data to ensure that the data is both standardized and correct. It then pickles the corrected data. Finally, it unpickles the data to print it out properly formatted.

CSV data format: `Last Name,First Name,Middle Initial,ID,Office Phone`

#### Instructions to Run
After cloning this repo locally, open a terminal in the Homework1 folder. From this terminal, run the following command with the relative filepath of the CSV file as an argument variable:

`python3 Homework1.py data/data.csv`

#### Strengths/Weaknesses of Python for Text Processing
Python is a very powerful language and I think it is a great tool to use for text processing. It has vast librarysupport for all kinds of data processing. While I chose not to use it, Python supports a library for processing CSV files. This and many more such libraries make python a versatile took for almost any situation. It also is dynamically typed which makes using the language significantly easier. This, in combination with the versatility and modularity of python's libraries makes it a personal favorite when it comes to languages to use for text processing. There are of course the tradeoffs of python being  slower with more overhead, due to the emphasis on its dynamic and interpreted nature. At the scale that I am working, however, I think these downsides are very reasonable to manage.

#### Skills Exercised
My main experience with this assignment was to refresh my python skills. Working with the python syntax, data structures, and file I/O were all reviews of my past experience with the language. One new skill I picked up was using python's regex capabilities. I had never  worked with regexes in python but I found the `re` module very intuitive.

## Homework 2
You can see the [code here](Homework2/PortfolioAssignment2.ipynb)
### Description
This Jupyter notebook contains explanations and demonstrations of some important functionalities of the NLTK library.

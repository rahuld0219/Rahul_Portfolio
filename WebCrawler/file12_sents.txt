Frog Information
A frog is any tailless, stout-bodied amphibian of the order Anura, including the smooth, moist-skinned frog species that live in a damp or semiaquatic habitat and the warty, drier-skinned toad species that are mostly terrestrial as adults, also called true frog, ranid.
any frog of the widespread family Ranidae, most members of which are semiaquatic and have smooth, moist skin and relatively long hind legs used for leaping.
A popular distinction is often made between frogs and toads on the basis of their appearance, but this has no taxonomic basis.
(Members of the anuran family Bufonidae are called true toads, but many species from other families are also called toads.)
In addition to their ecological importance, frogs have many cultural roles, such as in literature, symbolism and religion, and they are also valued as food and as pets.

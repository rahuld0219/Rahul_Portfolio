 Frog dissection  is a procedure used in undergraduate courses in zoology and high school biology classes. The procedure familiarizes a student with basic chordate anatomy. 
 In the Philippines,  Bufo marinus , or the common toad, is used.  Dissection is the cutting of a dead animal, and is the more common method.  However, vivisection, or the cutting of live animals, is still used as a means of instruction (and research).  Pithing is a procedure which attempts to sever the spinal cord from the brain using a scalpel, scissors, or probe/needle.
 
 Skinning the frog or toad [ edit  |  edit source ] 
 Pin the hands and legs on the wax-covered dissecting pan. 
 Pinch the frog's skin at the anal or cloacal region, making sure that it is detached from the muscles, If not, rub it gently, so that the connective tissues may loosen with the skin. 
 Cut a small hole there (in the anal or cloacal region) and cut forward, following an imaginary line called the linea alba. 
 As soon as you reach the chin, you can now stop cutting.

<h3 style='margin-top: 0px;'> Ghostarchive Search The Walking Dead season 9: Jon Bernthal to return as Shane From Jacob Stolworthy, published at Wed Jun 20 2018 The Walking Dead  may be losing two main cast members in its ninth season but that hasn't stopped the writers from plotting the comeback of one of its original stars. Following reports that Jon Bernthal had been spotted in photos taken around the Senoia, Georgia set alongside Andrew Lincoln and Norman Reedus,  Entertainment Weekly  has now confirmed that the actor will return as Shane Walsh in one episode. Bernthal's tenure on the series dates back to 2013. Shane was an original character who was killed by Rick in season two, a moment in which he became the first viewers saw come back as a walker despite having not been bitten. The character's reanimated corpse was gunned down by Carl (Chandler Riggs).  This means Shane can only come back in a flashback or hallucination like he did in season three. It's no stretch to assume that his appearance will arrive in the episode that will mark the exit of Lincoln's protagonist Rick Grimes whose  departure was reported  last month. Lauren Cohan - who plays Maggie Rhee - will also be  departing the series  following the full-season pick-up of her new comedy series  Whiskey Cavalier . Lincoln's departure leaves just two original cast members remaining on the show: Melissa McBride (Carol Peletier) and Daryl Dixon star Norman Reedus who will become  the new main character  in a deal that's set to make him one of the highest-paid TV stars, AMC has declined to comment.

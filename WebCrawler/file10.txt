 The "Tail" or Male Copulatory Organ 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 Adult male Coastal Tailed Frog showing his tail-like copulatory organ. This organ, an extension of the cloaca, is used to transfer sperm into the female's cloaca during amplexus. She then holds the fertilized eggs for 9 or 10 months when she swims under a large stone on the bottom of a fast-moving creek and attaches the eggs
                  to the bottom of the stone. This internal fertilization strategy lets tailed frogs breed in fast-moving water without the eggs washing away, which would happen if they were laid and fertilized on the surface of the water.

                    Tailed frog amplexus is inguinal - the male clasps the female around her pelvis, unlike most of the frogs in California, which use axial amplexus - the male grasps the female around her forelimbs.  
 When breeding, adult males develop rough pads on their feet called Nuptial Pads which help them to grab and hang on to the slippery skin of a female during amplexus.  Humboldt County                      ©  Spencer Riffle 
   
   
 
 
   
 
 
 Tadpoles

 Most  tadpoles have mouths at  the front of the head, but the mouth of a Coastal Tailed Frog tadpole is underneath the head, which is flattened. The mouth position and head shape, along with  specialized folds that create suction, help a tadpole cling to a rock surface while keeping its body close to the rock. This allows a tailed frog tadpole to scrape food off the surface of underwater rocks in fast-moving creeks without letting the swift current wash it downstream.

 Description 
 
 
   
 
 
 Size 
 
 
 A small frog, aduts are 1-2 inches in length (2.5 - 5.1 cm). (Stebbins, 2003) 
 
 
 
 Appearance 
 
 
  A flat, toadlike frog with fairly rough skin.  
                      The pupil is  vertical .  
                      The fingertips are hardened like claws to help the frog crawl among rocks on stream bottoms.  
                      Lungs are reduced in size to decrease buoyancy, and respiration takes place through the skin. 
 
 
 Color and Pattern 
 
 
  Coloring matches the colors of rocks around the stream inhabited - usually olive, brown, gray, or reddish above with yellow and gray mottling, a pale yellow or greenish triangle on the snout and a dark eye stripe. 
 
 
 Male/Female Differences 
 
 
 Males are smaller than females and have a "tail," which is actually a  copulatory organ. 
 
 
 Larvae (Tadpoles) 
 
 
 Tadpoles are black or brown, usually with a white spot on the tip of a long tail, and a large sucker-like mouth, which they use to cling to rocks in the fast-moving stream.  
 
 
 
 Life History and Behavior 
 
 
 Activity 
 
 
 Mostly nocturnal, but often seen moving on creek banks in daylight. 
Adults are usually active from April to October, depending on the locality. 
 
Tadpoles  emerge at night to forage on rocks. At times they can be found out foraging in daylight. 
 
 
  Defense 
 
 
 To escape predators Tailed Frogs jump into the water, tuck in their limbs, and let the water quickly carry them downstream away from danger.  
 
 
  Longevity 
 
 
 Adults are relatively long-lived - it has been speculated that they can live up to 15 - 20 years.  
 
 
 Voice 
 
 
  A male tailed frog has no vocal sacs and apparently does not vocalize, most likely due to the noisy stream environment it inhabits which would overwhelm any vocalization. Tailed frogs also have no external ear membrane to help them hear sounds. 
                        (Other frog species that inhabit fast-moving waters do vocalize with a sound too high-pitched to be heard by humans that can be heard over the noise of the water, and others produce sounds underwater.)  
 
 
 Diet and Feeding 
 
 
 Adults and juveniles eat  a wide variety of invertebrates, whatever is in season.  
Adults feed along stream banks and in the nearby forest at night and sometimes during daylight.  
 
Tadpoles  emerge at night to forage on rocks.  They sometimes crawl up onto rocks out of the water, probably to feed. Tadpoles have been found with ingested diatoms, algae, and desmids, and conifer pollen in their guts. 
 
 
 Reproduction 
 
 
 Reproduction is aquatic.  
                        Fertilization is internal.  
                        Amplexus is inguinal - the male grasps the female around her waist. 
 
                        Unlike all other frogs in the world, male Tailed Frogs do not fertilize the female's eggs in water, the eggs are fertilized internally by the male. (Other female frogs lay their eggs in the water and then the male fertilizes them.) This internal fertilization strategy has evolved to let Tailed Frogs breed more successfully in fast-moving water without the eggs and sperm washing away, which could happen if the eggs were laid and fertilized in the water.  Ascaphus  is the only genus of frogs that fertilizes internally through copulation. During successful mating, the male's tail-like organ, an extension of his cloaca, becomes erect and directed forward. The male, which is smaller than the female, clasps his arms around the female's pelvis (in what is called inguinal amplexus) and he then inserts his erected cloacal extension into the female's cloaca to transfer his sperm. This copulation lasts 24 - 30 hours. The female then stores the sperm, using it to fertilize the eggs months later. Then she lays the eggs under large rocks in the water.  
 
                        Reproduction is often delayed until four or five years after a frog has transformed from a tadpole.  
 
Breeding been reported in the spring and summer in coastal populations, and in the fall in Trinity County.  
(Thomson, Wright, & Shaffer, 2016) 
 
Adults do not travel to a breeding location, they breed in the cold, swift streams they inhabit.  
Females  may  breed only every other year, but they can store viable sperm for a year.    
(Thomson, Wright, & Shaffer, 2016) 
 
By mid-August to September, males have developed black, horny tubercles on each forefoot and forearm. These help a male hold on to a female during amplexus. 
 
Males of this species do not have vocal sacs so they don't call to attract a mate as most frogs do. It is not known exactly how males and females find each other and how females choose a mate. They most likely meet using chemical signals. 
 
An apparent  courtship attempt involving the similar species  Ascaphus montanus  was observed at 6:30 PM 8/6/17 in Idaho (Barton, Lashley, Altig, Herpetological Review 49(2), June 2018.) In a small shallow pool of water, the male approached the female and placed his front feet on her. The female rolled over on her back and remained motionless. The male took several different positions but did not attempt amplexus and eventually he departed. After the male left, the female remained motionless for several minutes more before leaving the pool.  
 
 
 
 Eggs 
 
 
 The female  lays her eggs in spring and summer after the spring runoff, generally July to September in California populations.  (Thomson, Wright, & Shaffer, 2016) 
 
                        An average clutch of 40 eggs are laid in continuous strings under large rocks.  
                        Eggs hatch into tadpoles in 3 - 6 weeks.  
 
Little is known about Coastal Tailed Frog nest sites. 
On August 3rd, 2005 a nest site in Mendocino County was found within a seep about 39 inches (1 m) above the confluence of the seep and a fish-bearing stream . The canopy vegetation was   primarily 40-year-old Coast Redwood and Douglas-fir enclosed 89 per cent. 25 eggs were attached in a continuous string to the bottom of a rock measuring about 5 x 4 1/2 inches (126 × 118 mm). On August 18th, all eggs had hatched and 5 tadpoles were seen in the seep.  
Matthew O. Goldsworthy Herpetological Review 38(1), 2007 
 
 
  Tadpoles and Young 
 
 
 Metamorphosis takes from one to two years in coastal populations and up to four years in montane populations. (Thomson, Wright, & Shaffer, 2016) 
                      Tadpoles always spend at least one winter in the stream. 
Where recently-transformed juveniles go after metamorphosis is not well known, but it appears that they disperse into the forest in the fall. 
 
 
 
 Habitat 
 
 
 Inhabits cold, clear, permanent rocky streams in wet forests.  They do not inhabit ponds or lakes. A rocky streambed is necessary for protective cover for adults, eggs, and larvae. After heavy rains, adults may be found in the woods away from the stream. (I found two adults under rocks about twenty meters from a creek in May.)  
                      Occasionally they inhabit  areas without trees. (According to Stebbins,  A. truei  quickly established itself on treeless terrain created by the eruption of Mt. St. Helens in Washington.)    
 
 
 Geographical Range 
 
 
 The range of this frog in California is from near Anchor Bay, Mendocino county, north along the coast to the Oregon Border and as far east as near Big Bend, Shasta County.  
                      The species ranges farther north through the Cascades Mountains of Oregon and Washington and along the north coast of British Columbia, almost to Alaska.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Elevational Range 
 
 
 From near sea level to 8400 ft. (2560 m.) 
 
 
 
 Notes on Taxonomy

 Conservation Issues   ( Conservation Status )  
 
 
 Tailed Frogs are extremely sensitive to warm temperatures. Tailed Frog populations may be severely reduced as a result of the sedimentation and warming of streams caused by timber harvesting and road building, but   there is no published evidence of a broad scale decline.

 CARS, not chainsaws, may be the biggest threat to the survival of North American frogs and toads. Globally, habitat loss is assumed to be the main factor eating away at amphibian populations, but in rural Canada, at least, traffic is the bigger danger. 
 Felix Eigenbrod of Carleton University in Ottawa and his colleagues surveyed 38 ponds in the countryside, estimating frog and toad numbers by visual searches in the day and listening for calls at night. They also recorded the amount of intact forest and wetland within 2 kilometres of the ponds, and the volume of road traffic in the area. 
 Heavy traffic was bad news for the amphibians, and for five out of six species it seemed to reduce populations more than the loss of their habitat. Species such as the leopard frog ( Rana pipiens ) appear to cope reasonably well with habitat reduction, Eigenbrod says, probably because they are sustained by patches of cover. He blames direct road kill, rather than traffic noise, for the loss of the amphibians. 
 “It is a good idea for major new roads to avoid areas with a big population of frogs and toads,” says Eigenbrod, who revealed his findings at the Society for Conservation Biology’s meeting in San Jose, California, last week. Advertisement
